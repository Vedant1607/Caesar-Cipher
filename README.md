# Caesar Cipher Program

This Python program implements a simple Caesar Cipher, which is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed amount down or up the alphabet. The program can both encode and decode messages.

## Features
- **Encoding**: Shift each letter in the text by a specified number of positions down the alphabet.
- **Decoding**: Shift each letter in the text by a specified number of positions up the alphabet (the reverse of encoding).
- **Continuous Use**: The program runs in a loop, allowing multiple encodings or decodings until the user decides to exit.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

## How to Use
1. Run the Program: Execute the Python script in your terminal or IDE.
2. Choose Action: When prompted, type encode to encrypt a message or decode to decrypt a message.
3. Enter Text: Input the text you want to encode or decode.
4. Shift Amount: Provide the number of positions you want the text to be shifted.
5. View Output: The program will display the encoded or decoded text.
6. Repeat or Exit: You can choose to rerun the program or exit by typing yes or no when prompted.
